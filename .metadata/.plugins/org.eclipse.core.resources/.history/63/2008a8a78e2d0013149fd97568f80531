/*
 * Create a Map<String,ArrayList<Integer>>. Use net.mindview.TextFile to open a
 * text file and read it in a word at a time (use "\\W+" as the second argument
 * to the TextFile constructor). Count the words as you read them in, and for
 * each word in the file, record in the ArrayList<Integer> the word count
 * associated with that word—this is, in effect, the location in the file where
 * that word was found.
