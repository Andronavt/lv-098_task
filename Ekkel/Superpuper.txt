The ability to map objects to other objects can be an immensely powerful way to solve 
programming problems. For example, consider a program to examine the randomness of 
Java’s Random class. Ideally, Random would produce a perfect distribution of numbers, 
but to test this you need to generate many random numbers and count the ones that fall in 
the various ranges. A Map easily solves the problem; in this case, the key is the number 
produced by Random, and the value is the number of times that number appears:
