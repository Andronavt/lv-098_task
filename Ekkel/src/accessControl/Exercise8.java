 * Following the form of the example Lunch.java, create a class called
 * ConnectionManager that manages a fixed array of Connection objects. The
 * client programmer must not be able to explicitly create Connection objects,
 * but can only get them via a static method in ConnectionManager. When the
 * ConnectionManager runs out of objects, it returns a null reference. Test the
 * classes in main( )
